        <h2>Early Life</h2>
         <pre>
            Dr. C.V. Raman was born on 7 November, 1888 in a South Indian Brahmin family in Tiruchirappalli,
            Tamil Nadu. His father's name was Chandrasekhara Ramanathan 
            Iyer who was a lecturer in Mathematics and Physics in a college in Vishakhapatnam.His mother's 
            name was Parvathi Ammal.

            C. V. Raman was an intelligent and brilliant student since his early childhood. At the age of 11, 
            he passed his matriculation and 12th class at the age of 13 on a scholarship. 
            In 1902, he joined the Presidency College and received his graduate degree in 1904.
            At that time, he was the only student who received the first division. He has done his Master's
            in Physics from the same college and broke all the previous records.In 1907, he married 
            Lokasundari Ammal and had two sons namely Chandrasekhar and Radhakrishnan.

        <h2>Career</h2>
         <pre>
            Because of his father's interest, he appeared for the Financial Civil Services (FCS) examination 
            and topped it. In 1907, he went to Calcutta (now Kolkata) and joined as Assistant Accountant
            General But in his spare time, he went to the laboratory to do research at the Indian Association 
            for Cultivation of Sciences. Let us tell you that, his job was very hectic then also he continued
            his research work at night due to his core interest in science.

            Though the facilities available in the laboratory were very limited, he continued his research and
            published his findings in leading international journals including 'Nature', 
            The Philosophical Magazine', 'Physics Review', etc. At that time, his research was focused on the
            areas of vibrations and acoustics.
            
            He got an opportunity to join the University of Calcutta in 1917, as the first Palit Professor of 
            Physics. After 15 years at Calcutta, he became the Professor at the Indian Institute of Science at 
            Bangalore from 1933-1948 and since 1948, he became the Director of the Raman Institute of  
            Research at Bangalore which was established and endowed by him only.

        <h2> Discovery And Works</h2>
    <pre>
            He established the Indian Journal of Physics in 1926 where he was the Editor. He also sponsored 
            the establishment of the Indian Academy of Sciences and served as the President since its   
            inception.He was the President of the Current Science Association in Bangalore, which publishes
            Current Science (India).

            In 1928, he wrote an article on the theory of musical instruments for the 8th Volume of the
            Handbuchder Physik. He published his work on the "Molecular Diffraction of Light" in 1922 which
            led to his ultimate discovery of the radiation effect on the 28th February 1928 and gained him 
            receive Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930. He became the first Indian to receive a Nobel Prize.
    
            Other researches carried out by Dr. C.V. Raman were: Diffraction of light by acoustic waves of
            ultrasonic and hypersonic frequencies and effects produced by X-rays on infrared vibrations in 
            crystals exposed to ordinary light.
    
            In 1948, he also studied the fundamental problems of crystal dynamics. His laboratory has been  
            dealing with the structure and properties of diamonds, and the structure and optical behaviour 
            of dealing iridescent substances like pearls, agate, opal, etc.
    
            He was also interested in the optics of colloids, electrical and magnetic anisotropy, and the 
            physiologyof human vision.
    
            No doubt, he was honoured with a large number of doctorates and memberships in scientific 
            societies. In 1924, he was also elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society early in his career  
            and was knighted in 1929.
    
            As briefly described that he is best known for discovering the 'Raman Effect' or the theory related 
            related to the scattering of light. He showed that when light traverses a transparent material,   
            some of the deflected light changes its wavelength.

        <h2>Award And Honours</h2>
<pre>
            In 1924, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society early in his career and was knighted
            in 1929. 
            He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930.
            He was awarded the Franklin Medal in 1941.
            He was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1954, the highest civilian award in India.
            In 1957, he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize.
            The American Chemical Society and the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in   
            1998 recognised Raman's discovery as an International Historic Chemical Landmark.
            On 28 February every year, India celebrates National Science Day to commemorate the  
            discovery of the Raman Effect in 1928 in his honour.
